to make seamless between clien and server...
  pass in arguments to the called function
   normal scalars, lists, hashes and yote objects
   but also functions for file objects

   the function could look like
       yote.include_files( '.filecontrols' ) which returns functions that return the
       file objects

on the other side, those functions come across as files
